📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive financial model built to evaluate a company’s intrinsic value using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. The model integrates detailed assumptions, revenue and cost build-up, working capital management, financial statements, and valuation outputs.
The primary motive of this project is to demonstrate how financial modelling and valuation techniques can be applied in real-world corporate finance, investment analysis, and decision-making.

🏗️ Model Structure

The model is designed in a modular format with the following key components:

Assumptions – Base, best, and worst-case scenarios for revenue growth, margins, capex, and financing.
Revenue & Cost Build-up – Drivers for sales projections and expense estimates.
Working Capital – Analysis of receivables, payables, and inventory cycles.
Fixed Assets Schedule – Capital expenditure, depreciation, and asset life.
Financing – Debt schedules, interest expense, and equity assumptions.
Financial Statements – Projected Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, and Fund Flow.
Valuation (DCF) – Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF), discounting using WACC, and terminal value calculation.
Charts & Visualization – Graphical representation of revenues, profits, and valuation sensitivity.

🔍 Key Findings

Projected revenues, EBITDA, and net profit over a 10+ year horizon.
Estimated free cash flows and derived company valuation using WACC-based discounting.
Identified sensitivity of valuation to changes in growth rate, margins, and discount rate.
Developed automated dashboards and charts for easy interpretation.
